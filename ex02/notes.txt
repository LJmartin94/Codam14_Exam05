ClassName& ClassName::operator=(const ClassName& assignment) :
{
    this->value = assignment.value;
    return(*this);
}


Implemented clone function is just (used by learnSpell):

ClassName* ClassName::clone() const
{
    return (new ClassName(*this));
}

use .count() to check if an element exists in a map.
use .erase() to remove an element from a map, but make sure you 'delete' the allocated portion first.
